  <h1> Anatomy of a Css Rules </h1>
  <h2> Selectors </h2>
  <p> Any HTML element is a possibke CSS 1 selector.The selector is simply the elemnt that is linked to a particular style.
  For exampleexample,selector in { text-indent:3em} is P.
  </p>

  <h2>class Selectors</h2>

  <p>A simple selector can have differen classes,thus allowing the same element to have different style . for example,an author
  may wish to sisplay code in a diffferent color depending on its language:<br>
  code.html{ color : #191970} <br>
  code.css{color: #4b0082} <br>
  The above example has created two classes, css and html for use with HTML's CODE element . The CLASS attribute ius used in HTML<br>
  to indicate the class of an elements,e.g.,

  <P CLASS =warning>Only one class in allowed per selector.<br>
  For example, code.html.proprietary is invalid.</P>
  In this case, the note class may be used with any elemnent.<br>
  A good practice is to name classes according to their function rather than their appearance. The note class in the above example<br>
  could have been named small,but this name wouls become meaningless if the author decided to changes the style of the class so the<br>
  that it no longer had a small font size.
